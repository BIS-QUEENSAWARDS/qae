Dear <%= @recipient.full_name %>,

We are emailing to remind you that you have until

#<%= @deadline_time %> on <%= @deadline %>

to provide actual figures & VAT returns by following the link below:

<%= users_form_answer_audit_certificate_url(@form_answer) %>

#We cannot extend this deadline.

If you do not submit your actual figures & VAT returns before the deadline, we will not have sufficient information to assess your application, and it will be withdrawn.

Below is a reminder of the steps you need to take:

  1. If you do not have your filled-in application form handy, download it by logging into your Queen's Award account dashboard via the link:
     <%= users_form_answer_audit_certificate_url(@form_answer) %>
  2. Download the filled-in application form in the shortlisted entries in the table on the dashboard page to see questions <%= @question_refs %>.
  3. Create your own document with updated answers to questions <%= @question_refs %>. You can do so in any popular document format, including Word, Excel and PDF.
  4. Login again and upload the document with actual figures and the latest year’s VAT returns one by one by following the “Upload actual figures and VAT returns” link.

Yours sincerely,

Nichola Bruno
Head, The Queen’s Awards for Enterprise Office
