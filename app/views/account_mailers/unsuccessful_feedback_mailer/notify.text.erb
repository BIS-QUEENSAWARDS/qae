#The Queen's Awards for Enterprise <%= @year %> [<%= @form_answer.urn %>]

Dear <%= @name %>,

Thank you for your entry to The Queen's Awards for Enterprise <%= @year %>. I am sorry to inform you that your organisation was not among those recommended to Her Majesty The Queen for an Award this year.

This year's entries were of a very high standard and selecting those organisations which had demonstrated the most outstanding achievements was particularly difficult.

I understand that the application process can be time consuming and, for this reason, our assessors have compiled some feedback on your application which we hope will help with any future applications you make.

You can view your application feedback via the link below:

Please also find, at Annex A, some contacts, both within government and externally, which I hope you might find useful.

Thank you once again for taking the time to enter The Queen's Awards for Enterprise and I wish you every success in the future.

Yours sincerely,

Nichola Bruno
The Secretary
The Queen's Awards Office
