Dear <%= @user.decorate.full_name %>,

Yesterday, we sent you an email asking you to provide verification of commercial figures by submitting the External Accountant’s Report.

However, initially, the External Accountant’s Report form had a wrong deadline of 22nd September 2021. This has now been amended to the correct deadline of:
#midday on 26th November 2021.

Please accept our sincere apologies for the inconvenience caused.

Yours sincerely,

The Queen's Awards Office
