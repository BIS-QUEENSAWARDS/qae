#Congratulations on winning a Queen's Award for Enterprise: <%= @form_answer.award_type_full_name %> <%= @form_answer.award_year.year %>

Dear <%= @name %>,

I am delighted to inform you that Her Majesty The Queen has approved the Prime Minister's recommendation that your company should receive a Queen's Award for Enterprise in the <%= @form_answer.award_type_full_name %> category this year. We have also informed the head of your organisation by email.

If you are a Collaborator please liaise with the account holder.

#Please read this email carefully as it contains important information about actions you need to do now.

#Official Announcement and Embargo Terms

The Award will be announced publicly on <%= @deadline.try :strftime, "%d %B %Y" %>. Although you can make arrangements for publicity now, and we would encourage you to do so.

#There is a strict embargo preventing public announcement or publication of any Awards information until 01:00hrs on <%= @deadline.try :strftime, "%d %B %Y" %>. You must not make any announcement about your Award, either to employees or outside your organisation, before this date.

Under the terms of the embargo, we will provide information including a list of winners and their press contact details, to the media on <%= @media_deadline %>. The list of winners will then be published in the supplement to the London Gazette. Prior to the official announcement, you may be contacted by the press regarding your Award. You are permitted to speak to them however this will still be under embargo conditions. You are also permitted to approach your own press contacts to arrange coverage around your Award; please, however,

#Make it clear to anyone you approach in the media, that they cannot publish anything until <%= @deadline.try :strftime, "%d %B %Y" %>.

#Approve your Press Book entry, which is a factual account of why you have won the Award and not a promotional press opportunity.

Log in via this link: <%= dashboard_url %> to access the Winners' Dashboard in order to:

* check the Press Book entry (a factual account of why you have won the Award and not a promotional press opportunity);
* check the other details for your organisation are correct; and,
* check the details of your contact for press enquiries.

#Then click the "Submit" button by 12:00 noon on <%= @book_notes_deadline %>. If you do not respond by the deadline, we will use the proposed text together with the contact details that we already hold.

#Winners’ Manual

On your online account, you will also have access to the Winners’ Manual, which provides all relevant information about your award and the use of the emblem for marketing/promotion. You can also access the Queen's Awards <%= @form_answer.award_year.year %> emblems.

By accepting the Award, you agree to the terms set out in the Winners' Manual.

#Reception at Buckingham Palace

There will be an opportunity this Summer for representatives from each winning organisation to attend a Reception at Buckingham Palace. As on previous occasions, numbers will be limited to two current employees and we would encourage you to nominate one senior and one junior employee to attend. A Member of the Royal Family will be present at the reception but with the numbers attending it will, of course, be impossible for guests to be met individually. Please could you make this clear to them when nominating your representatives. Your representatives will, however, be able to meet fellow winners and Government Ministers and Senior Business Leaders are also expected to attend the event.

We will contact you closer to the time to confirm the attendees.

#Like all future mass gatherings, we are keeping the situation under review and will act in line with the Government's advice.

Congratulations once again on your Award.

Yours sincerely,

Nichola Bruno
The Secretary
The Queen's Awards Office
