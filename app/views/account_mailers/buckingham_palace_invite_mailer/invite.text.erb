Earlier today, we have sent you an email regarding the Reception on behalf of The Queen at Windsor Castle.

However, the email title was erroneously referring to Buckingham Palace. Please note, the correct location is Windsor Castle.

Please accept our sincere apologies for the inconvenience caused.

Yours sincerely,
