Dear <%= @name %>,

Earlier today, we have sent you an email regarding the Royal Reception on behalf of The Royal Household.

However, the email title referred to Buckingham Palace as the venue. The correct location for the Reception is Windsor Castle.

Please note, we will confirm the exact time of the Reception to be held on the 10th of November, in due course.

Please accept our sincere apologies for the inconvenience caused.

Yours sincerely,

The Queenâ€™s Awards Office
